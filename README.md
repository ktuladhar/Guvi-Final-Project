<h1>Project Name: Toxic Tweets Dataset : NLP Problem</h1>
<p>This dataset has a collection of Tweets. Its labelled as Toxic - 1, Non toxic - 0. Apply the NLP methods to predict the toxicity of the tweets. Download the dataset from the following Kaggle Compitation</p> <p>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwiniyer176/toxic-tweets-dataset</p>

<p> All the credits to the original collectors.
Procedure:</p>
<p>1. Convert the CSV file to the panda data frame.</p>
<p>2. Convert the text to the following.
• Bag of Words
• TF-IDF</p>
<p>3. For the obtained features, apply the following methods of prediction.
• Decision Trees
• Random forest
• Naive Bayes Model
• K-NN Classifier
• SVM</p>
<p>4. For each of this method produce the following metrics:
• Precision, Recall, F1 - Score
• Confusion Matrix
• RoC - AUC curve</p>
